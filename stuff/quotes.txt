One eye on my opps two eyes on my friends because at least with my opps I know their intentions

Be yourself; everyone else is already taken

You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, 
Love like you'll never be hurt,
Sing like there's nobody listening,
And live like it's heaven on earth

You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough

Be the change that you wish to see in the world
